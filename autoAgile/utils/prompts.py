CRITICAL RULES:

1. ONLY extract requirements EXPLICITLY stated in the source text
2. DO NOT infer, assume, or add requirements based on best practices
3. DO NOT add features common to other systems (auth, search, profiles, etc.)
4. If functionality is not mentioned in the source, DO NOT include it
5. Every requirement must have a direct quote from the source as evidence

EXTRACTION PROCESS:

Step 1: Extract Requirements
- Read the source text carefully
- Identify each distinct functional requirement
- Look for ALL major functionalities:
  * Data collection and processing
  * Communication methods (satellite, radio, etc.)
  * Storage mechanisms (local storage, data aggregation)
  * Failure handling (backup instruments, recovery processes)
  * Power management (battery charging, generator control)
  * System reconfiguration capabilities
  * Self-contained operation features
- For each requirement, capture:
  * Brief requirement statement (5-10 words)
  * Direct quote from source text as evidence
  * Confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Don't just extract bullet points - extract contextual capabilities too

OUTPUT FORMAT:

  "requirements": [
    {{
      "id": 1,
      "statement": "brief requirement",
      "source_quote": "exact text from source",

❌ Adding authentication when source doesn't mention it
❌ Adding user profiles when source doesn't mention them
❌ Adding search when source doesn't mention it
❌ Changing "automatic transmission" to "user uploads"
❌ Inventing metrics like "24 hours" when not in source

def extract_epics(requirements:str,chat, mode)->str:
    pp = """You are a requirements extraction system. Extract user stories, deliverables, and test cases from the provided source text.

🚨 CRITICAL: SYSTEM BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT 🚨

The source text may describe MULTIPLE systems. You MUST identify which system each requirement belongs to and ONLY extract requirements for the PRIMARY TARGET SYSTEM.

COMMON SYSTEM TYPES IN SOURCE TEXTS:
1. **Individual Component System** (e.g., "Weather Station System") - ONE instance doing its job
   - Example: "The weather station collects data" → EXTRACT THIS
   - Example: "The station processes data locally" → EXTRACT THIS

2. **Aggregation/Management System** (e.g., "Data Management System") - Collects from MULTIPLE instances
   - Example: "The system collects data from ALL weather stations" → DO NOT EXTRACT (wrong system)
   - Example: "The system archives data for other systems" → DO NOT EXTRACT (wrong system)
   - Keywords: "all stations", "multiple", "aggregates from", "collects from all"

3. **Monitoring/Maintenance System** (e.g., "Station Maintenance System") - Monitors MULTIPLE instances
   - Example: "The system monitors ALL weather stations" → DO NOT EXTRACT (wrong system)
   - Example: "The system provides reports of problems across stations" → DO NOT EXTRACT (wrong system)
   - Keywords: "monitors stations", "reports problems", "remote control of stations"

EXTRACTION RULES:
✅ EXTRACT: Requirements describing what ONE instance of the target system does
✅ EXTRACT: Self-contained operations (collects, processes, stores, manages its own resources)
❌ DO NOT EXTRACT: Requirements about "all instances" or "multiple instances"
❌ DO NOT EXTRACT: Requirements about collecting from other systems
❌ DO NOT EXTRACT: Requirements about monitoring other systems
❌ DO NOT EXTRACT: Requirements about archiving for other systems

VALIDATION CHECK:
Before including a requirement, ask: "Does this describe what ONE instance does, or what a system managing MULTIPLE instances does?"
- If ONE instance → EXTRACT
- If MULTIPLE instances → SKIP (wrong system)

CRITICAL RULES:

1. ONLY extract requirements EXPLICITLY stated in the source text
2. DO NOT infer, assume, or add requirements based on best practices
3. DO NOT add features common to other systems (auth, search, profiles, etc.)
4. If functionality is not mentioned in the source, DO NOT include it
5. Every requirement must have a direct quote from the source as evidence
6. ONLY extract requirements for the PRIMARY TARGET SYSTEM (not aggregation/monitoring systems)

ZERO TOLERANCE FOR INVENTED METRICS:
❌ NEVER add: percentages, time windows, success rates, specific numbers
❌ NEVER write: "90%", "2 hours", "30 transmissions", "80% of components", "within 5 minutes", "does not exceed 2 seconds"
✅ ONLY USE: qualitative terms from source text
✅ WRITE: "successfully", "reliably", "when conditions permit", "efficiently"

SOURCE QUOTE MANDATORY:
- Every requirement MUST include exact quote from source
- Every DoD statement MUST reference specific source text
- If you can't find a quote, don't include the metric

COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENT:
- Create ONE user story for EACH requirement (NO EXCEPTIONS)
- If input has N requirements, output MUST have N user stories
- Count requirements in input and ensure story count matches exactly
- Extract EVERY distinct function mentioned in source
- Missing functions = incomplete requirements

EXTRACTION PROCESS:

Step 2: Create User Stories
Format: "The system must [ACTION] so that [BUSINESS VALUE]"

Rules for "so that" clause:
- Must provide actual business benefit, NOT circular logic
- Must be based on source text context
- BAD: "collect data so that it can monitor hardware" (different functions)
- GOOD: "collect data so that weather conditions can be recorded"
- BAD: "monitor hardware so that it can detect failures" (circular)
- GOOD: "monitor hardware so that problems are identified before data loss"

Step 3: Define Deliverables
- Use unique, descriptive names (NO generic names like "Data Management")
- Base Definition of Done on source text details
- DO NOT invent metrics not in source (NO seconds, minutes, percentages, hours)
- Use qualitative terms: "efficiently", "quickly", "reliably", "successfully"
- BAD: "within 5 minutes", "does not exceed 2 seconds", "24 hours battery life", "90% success rate"
- GOOD: "successfully transmits aggregated data", "processes data efficiently", "maintains operation reliably"
- Include specific technical details from source (communication methods, storage mechanisms, failure handling)

EXTRACT ALL MAJOR FUNCTIONALITIES:
- Look for: communication methods (satellite, radio, etc.)
- Look for: storage mechanisms (local storage, data aggregation)
- Look for: failure handling (backup instruments, recovery processes)
- Look for: hardware monitoring and fault reporting
- Look for: power management (generator shutdown in high wind, battery charging)
- Look for: system reconfiguration (backup instrument failover, software updates)
- Don't just extract bullet points - extract contextual capabilities too

- [ ] All stories have source text basis with exact quotes
- [ ] All major functions from source are covered
- [ ] Verify: valid JSON structure (no nested string arrays, no malformed sections)

EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
❌ Adding authentication when source doesn't mention it
❌ Adding user profiles when source doesn't mention them
❌ Adding search when source doesn't mention it
❌ Using "so that it can do X" when X is part of the requirement itself
❌ Inventing metrics like "24 hours", "5 minutes", "2 seconds", "90%", "30 transmissions" when not in source
❌ Creating fewer user stories than requirements
❌ Generic DoD statements without source reference

EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO DO:
✅ Only include features explicitly in source text
✅ Quote source text as evidence for each requirement
✅ User stories with clear business value: "so that weather forecasts are more accurate"
✅ ONE story per requirement (if 5 requirements, then 5 stories)
✅ Qualitative terms: "efficiently", "successfully", "reliably"
✅ DoD statements that reference specific source text

ZERO TOLERANCE FOR INVENTED METRICS:
❌ NEVER add: percentages, time windows, success rates, specific numbers
❌ NEVER write: "90%", "2 hours", "30 transmissions", "80% of components"
✅ ONLY USE: qualitative terms from source text

🚨 CRITICAL: TEST CASES MUST BE CONCRETE AND SPECIFIC 🚨

ZERO TOLERANCE FOR TEMPLATE TEST CASES:
❌ NEVER write: "Verify that the system must [requirement]"
❌ NEVER write: "Functionality works as specified"
❌ NEVER write: "Functionality works as specified in the user story"
❌ NEVER write: "Test cases will be defined during test planning"
❌ NEVER write: Generic test outputs like "weather_data", "data", "result"
❌ NEVER write: Vague expected outputs without concrete values
✅ ALWAYS write: Specific input data with concrete values + Expected output data with concrete values
✅ ALWAYS write: Test names that describe the specific scenario being tested
✅ ALWAYS write: Expected outputs with actual data types, formats, and example values

TEMPLATE DETECTION - IF YOU SEE THESE PATTERNS, YOU'RE WRONG:
- "Verify that the system must..." → WRONG (template)
- "Functionality works as specified" → WRONG (template)
- "Test: [requirement copy-paste]" → WRONG (template)
- Expected: "weather_data" → WRONG (too generic)
- Expected: "success" → WRONG (too generic, add details)

REQUIRED FORMAT - CONCRETE TEST CASES:
✅ Test name: "Collect temperature reading from sensor TEMP-001"
✅ Input: {{"instrument": "temperature_sensor", "sensor_id": "TEMP-001", "interval": "60_seconds"}}
✅ Expected: {{"value": 20.5, "unit": "celsius", "timestamp": "2025-11-17T12:30:00Z", "status": "valid"}}

COMPLETENESS REQUIREMENT:
- Create test cases for EVERY requirement (minimum 2 scenarios per requirement)
- If input has N requirements, output MUST have N test case groups
- Count requirements in input and ensure test case count matches exactly
- Include edge cases explicitly mentioned in source

EXTRACTION PROCESS:

Step 4: Create Test Cases
- Cover ALL variations mentioned in source (e.g., if source lists 6 instruments, test all 6)
- Use concrete, realistic data structures with actual values
- Include specific expected outputs with data types and formats
- Add edge cases explicitly mentioned in source:
  * Communication failures (satellite link loss, radio failure)
  * Hardware malfunctions (instrument failure, power issues)
  * Environmental conditions (high wind, extreme temperatures)
  * Failover scenarios (backup instrument switching, generator shutdown)

CONCRETE TEST CASE FORMAT - EXAMPLES:

❌ BAD - Generic Template (DO NOT USE):
  "Test: Verify that the system must collect weather data
   Expected: Functionality works as specified"
   
❌ BAD - Another Template (DO NOT USE):
  "Test: Verify that the system must [requirement]
   Expected: Functionality works as specified in the user story"

✅ GOOD - Specific with Concrete Data (USE THIS):
{{
  "test_name": "Collect temperature reading from sensor TEMP-001",
  "input": {{
    "instrument": "temperature_sensor",
    "sensor_id": "TEMP-001",
    "reading_interval": "60_seconds"
  }},
  "expected_output": {{
    "value": 20.5,
    "unit": "celsius",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-15T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "valid"
  }}
}}

✅ GOOD - Another Specific Example:
{{
  "test_name": "Transmit aggregated hourly data via satellite",
  "input": {{
    "data_type": "aggregated_weather_data",
    "satellite_status": "connected",
    "data_size": "1024_bytes",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-15T10:00:00Z"
  }},
  "expected_output": {{
    "transmission_status": "success",
    "bytes_sent": 1024,
    "acknowledgment_received": true,
    "transmission_time": "2025-11-15T10:00:05Z"
  }}
}}

TEST CASE FORMAT:
{{
  "testCases": [
    {{
      "requirement_id": 1,
      "scenarios": [
        {{
          "name": "Test [specific scenario with concrete data]",
          "input": {{
            "field": "concrete_value_with_type",
            "another_field": "concrete_value"
          }},
          "expected_output": {{
            "field": "concrete_value_with_type",
            "another_field": "concrete_value"
          }}
        }},
        {{
          "name": "Test [edge case scenario with concrete data]",
          "input": {{
            "field": "concrete_value"
          }},
          "expected_output": {{
            "field": "concrete_value_with_type"
          }}
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

EDGE CASES TO COVER (if mentioned in source):
- Generator shutdown protocol in high wind (with concrete wind speed values from source)
- Backup instrument switching mechanism (with specific instrument IDs)
- Communication failure recovery process (with specific failure scenarios)
- Local data storage during outages (with specific storage capacity if mentioned)
- Data aggregation for bandwidth optimization (with specific data structures)

VALIDATION CHECKLIST BEFORE OUTPUT:
- [ ] Count requirements in input
- [ ] Count test case groups in output - MUST MATCH
- [ ] Each requirement has minimum 2 test scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases from source are included
- [ ] All test cases have concrete input/output data (not generic "verify that")
- [ ] No invented numbers or metrics in test cases

EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO DO:
❌ Generic test outputs like "weather_data" instead of structured data
❌ Generic "Verify that the system must [requirement]" statements
❌ "Functionality works as specified" as expected output
❌ Inventing test scenarios not mentioned in source
❌ Missing test cases for some requirements
❌ Test cases without concrete input/output data

EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO DO:
✅ Specific test data: {{"temperature": 20.5, "pressure": 1013.2, "timestamp": "2025-11-15T10:30:00Z"}}
✅ Concrete input: {{"instrument": "temperature_sensor", "interval": "60s"}}
✅ Concrete expected output: {{"value": 20.5, "unit": "C", "status": "valid"}}
✅ Cover all edge cases mentioned in source (failures, environmental conditions, etc.)
✅ ONE test case group per requirement (if 5 requirements, then 5 test case groups)
